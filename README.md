# Basic Particle Simulator

A simple 'particle' collision simulator based on the Verlet integration

Implemented in C++ with RayLib

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple physics simulation using Verlet integration. The simulation includes round objects that can be added to the screen by clicking the mouse, and these objects interact with each other and the circular constraint using basic physics principles.

## Dependencies

- **raylib**: A simple graphical application development library.
